# CHO-MATE

This is the CHO-MATE Hypoglycemic Center Project for ECEN 403 and ECEN 404 at Texas A&M University.

## The Problem
In the U.S. Alone over 10% of the population suffers from Diabetes. Type 1 diabetes can require a person to monitor their blood sugar level 4-10 times a day and intake carbohydrates if their blood sugar is low. This can become a guess and check game where the person is not able to consistently and accurately dose themselves, and can lead to detrimental effects on quality of life.

## Our Solution
Our device shall be a tool for those who suffer from Hypoglycemia in order to take preventative action to dose the user when their blood sugar begins to drop below acceptable conditions. We hope to provide a smooth running and adaptive source of accurate sugar dispensing to our consumers. Accomplishing both a maintenance efficient and emergency equipped system to ease some of the stress that the user must deal with on a day to day basis.
